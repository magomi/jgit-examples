jgit-examples
=============

This project contains some examples how to use jgit (http://eclipse.org/jgit/).

jgit may be a good library to integrate dscm functionalities into your project but it lacks a usable documentation.

I will share my experiences while working out how to use the jgit library. I will collect short sample programs showing how some functionalities can be used.

Anybody who also has some sample codes is invited to contribute.
