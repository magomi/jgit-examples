jgit-examples
=============

This project contains some examples how to use jgit (<a href="http://eclipse.org/jgit/">http://eclipse.org/jgit/</a>).

Documentation to jgit can be found at <a href="http://wiki.eclipse.org/JGit/User_Guide">http://wiki.eclipse.org/JGit/User_Guide</a>.
I found it only by accident because the <a href="http://eclipse.org/jgit/">project page</a> has now link to it.

I will share my experiences while working out how to use the jgit library. I will collect short sample programs showing
how some functions can be used.

Anybody who also has some sample codes is invited to contribute.
